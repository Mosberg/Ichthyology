## 🔬 Development Goals

This mod aims to combine **scientific realism** with **Minecraft’s sandbox charm**. Inspired by real-world ichthyology, the goal is to make Minecraft’s oceans more than background scenery — turning them into living, researchable ecosystems.

Core focuses:
- AI-driven ecology simulation.
- Compatibility with Fabric mods (e.g., REI, Mod Menu).
- Modular code structure for easy content expansion.
